Vibhishan Kavach is the first part of the Moksha mobile computing framework.
Vibhishan Kavach is an android application which monitors the users health.
Vibhishan Kavach has the following features:
 - Capture heart rate using the redness (haemoglobin content) in one's index finger when it is gently pressed on the flash light of the mobile device.
 - Capture respiratory rate of the user using the slope deviation due to breathing movement using the mobile device's accelometer.
